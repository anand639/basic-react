Declarative Approach 


index.js first file to execute

just adding custom HTML element and nothing else

Props means pass the data 

we use parameters to pass data into the function

in the expense with the props if you want to pass the data of key value pair at once so just add the <name> like expense (easy name) and pass the data at once by using the {props.expense.title} and in the app.js  file expense={expenses[3]} this is called the array value in the expenses[3] means this is the 3rd value of the key-value pair in the array.
